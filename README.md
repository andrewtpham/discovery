# Discovery

This repository is a collection of data projects I'm taking on as I refresh and hone in my data skills.

## How its organized

Each folder will include a `notebook.ipynb` file and another folder of all datasets used.

## Getting started

### Set up a virtual environment

```
pip3 install virtualenv

python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name> // python3.9 -m venv env
```

```
. venv/bin/activate

deactivate
```

### Install packages

At the root folder, there's a `requirements.txt` file with a complete list of packages used in the notebooks in the repo.

For specific packages required for each notebook, see the `requirements.txt` file found under each project folder. This is generated by a script inside each notebook. 

Example

```
%%writefile requirements.txt

pandas==2.1.3
openpyxl==3.1.2
```

> Before installing packages, make sure your virtual environment is activated.

To install packages required, run:

`pip3 install -r <project-folder>/requirements.txt` // where <project-folder> is the name of the folder you want to run.

Alternatively, you can run the main requirements.txt on the root folder:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
